          <p>Our whole continent was in a hot dense state <br>And nearly 400 years of slavery couldn't wait. <br>The British began to drool <br>And imperialism was cool <br>Because Africa needed <em><b>"school"</b></em>.</p>
          <p><em>SCHOOL</em> you said?<br> <br>They took our fathers to cotton fields <br>To fight wars that needed no shields. <br>They had a head start and free labour<br>And they got this by dividing us from our neighbour.</p>
          <p>With all our rubber, steel and diamonds they went <br>0nly to start off an era of resent.</p>
          <p>Then came WW1, 2 and a sense of liberation.<br>But it was all an act of deliberation <br>Of a new form of modern colonization.</p>
          <p>The cold war that followed brought us a wall and atomic bomb <br>As well as a series of western norms.<br>It also brought us India and Pakistan <br>Uzbekistan, Kyrgystan, Tajikistan .</p>
          <p>We were promised world peace by the United Nations <br>But all they did was test our patience, <br>As our oil fueled their petrol stations .</p>
          <p>The IMF handed out loans. Ah! What a fallacy!<br>To continue to feed us their development fantasy.<br>They encouraged the export of raw materials:<br>Minerals, metals, breads and cereals.<br>They gave us pennies in return, <br>What debt was, we had to learn.</p>
          <p>Around the world, no Robin Hood was seen.<br>And money only mattered if it was green.<br>They devalued our currency. <br>Education and health care were no longer an urgency .<br>They forced a reduction in social and governmental spending.<br>Now the consequences are never ending.</p>
          <p>The rich became Warner Bros.<br>Yet the rest of us couldn't even afford to watch their shows. <br>The gap between the rich and the poor has grown.<br>Along with the West, the 1% exploited their own .</p>
          <p>9/11, enough said, <br>But was the Quran even read? <br>Al-Qaeda, Taliban and Isis <br>Say hello to the new global security crisis.</p>
          <p>The Universal Declaration of Human Rights <br>Was not an invitation to enter our fights .<br>In the midst of creating the perfect society <br>We forgot all about refugees anxiety.</p>
          <p>"Africa is a land of savages" and "All Muslims are terrorists", they say <br>How ignorant is your education system anyway? <br>Foreign aid always came with strings attached <br>And the donor intentions never matched.</p>
          <p>And now, </p>
          <p>Real wages have dropped massively.<br>Yet we continue to complain passively.<br>Companies from afar are now incharge.<br>And locals lose their jobs at large.</p>
          <p>Health care has become a luxury.<br>Only the rich can afford surgery.<br>More children and mothers are dying .<br>Why can't anyone hear our crying?</p>
          <p>Our resources are depleting,<br>Yet our chimneys are still competing.<br>We try meeting after meeting .<br>But will we even have something to keep eating.</p>
          <p>It is time to put a stop to this! <br>The constant meddling we won't miss.<br>Africa doesn't need to be saved.<br>Definitely not with their fooling aid. <br>Our problems we will fix on our own.<br>No more of their Goddamn loan.</p>
          <p>Hey but <em><b>HOW</b></em>? </p>
          <p>A united civil society we will create.<br>One without tribal or cultural hate.<br>Education, health care and peace is the way.<br>Let's remember that everyday.</p>
