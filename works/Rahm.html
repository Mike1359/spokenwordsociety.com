          <p><em>This is for the mothers of war.<br>For the women from whom war has taken everything.<br>For the women who hold the last hopes of war.<br>This is for the women of Afghanistan and Iran<br>Of Syria and Libya, or Iraq and Yemen.<br>This is for the mothers of the past, the future and the present.<br>This is for you.</em></p>

          <p>The silence came to a <b>screeching halt</b>, when she began screeching. Soon her screeches turned into screams and her screams <b>ripped the cosmos to shreds</b>. Her cries the sound of <b>cities burning to the ground</b>. The sheer desperation and despair in her voice broke every single person around her. And in the most terrifyingly beautiful way, her cries gave us a peek into her soul. <b>Her pain</b> a spectacular spectacle. Making us feel things we had <b>never</b> felt before. </p>
          <p><b>Her son had died.</b> </p>
          <p>He had died and there was nothing she could do about it. Her little boy was no more. And we could feel that in her ballad to the heavens. In her <b>plea for a miracle</b> woven in threads of hate. In every emotion she felt, we bore <b>witness</b>. Stunned. Awed. Ashamed. I could have sworn that in her deafening screams I could see the <b>rhythm of her soul</b>. I could feel the <b>color of her pain</b>. And what a color. It was the color of <b>loss</b>, of <b>hate</b>, of <b>despair</b>. It was the color of hopelessness with the <b>slightest hue of hope</b> for the impossible. Short-lived. </p>
          <p>And <b>we watched</b>. In a trance. Too afraid to make a <b>move</b> and <b>break</b> the scene unfolding before us. Just as she, we were <b>trapped</b>. Not in a scream, but by one. It was not until the chains were gone had we realized that we’d been <b>bound</b>, breathless. That's when we saw it. She was no longer a person. Only an object. <b>Broken</b>. As she lay upon her son's body for she had <b>exhausted</b> every avenue, every cell of her being, in her pleas for resurrection. </p>
          <p><b>Mute</b>. The only word in my mind as silence took over once more. <b>Mute</b> were her efforts. Her screams <b>muted</b> by her exhaustion. Her eyes red and puffy. Her face tear-struck. <em>She wasn't wearing any mascara.</em> I don't know why I noticed that but there was no mascara, no lipstick. Her face was <b>bare</b>, her <b>exposition exposing</b> her innermost thoughts. Visible to anyone wanting to observe. Only no observation could be made. For even in her silence she <b>held us captive</b>. </p>
          <p>A <b>ghost</b>. That's what she was. A ghost. Alive? Sure. Her heart beat still pure. But her <b>eyes</b> were <b>dead</b>. Her <b>soul diminished</b>. She was gone. She was gone for she had <b>failed</b>. She had failed for her son was lost. Her son was lost for <b>WE</b> had failed. For <b>we</b> had chosen to look away. For <b>we</b> had chosen to let things stay… the same as they have for generations. <b>We had killed her.</b> And she had died. Long before the <b>second bullet</b> left the gun. Long before the <b>second bullet</b> crushed through her skull, cruised through her brain and came out the other end. She was dead long before we heard the <b>second gunshot</b>. </p>
          <p>And time was <b>lost</b>. It could have been hours, seconds, minutes, days, weeks, years, months that that moment lasted. Only it didn’t matter anymore. For Time was <b>lost upon that broken woman</b>.</p>
          <p>For her son had <b>died</b>. He had died and there was <b>nothing she could do about it</b>. Her little boy was <b>no more</b>. And in that <b>endless moment</b>, in her <b>infallible failure</b>, she had died <b>with him</b>. A <b>broken</b> woman on the <b>broken</b> pavement in that <b>broken</b> city. Mother no longer.</p>
